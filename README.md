# PowerPay - Micropayment Wallet

A blockchain-based digital wallet using Node.js, React, and Solana, enabling low-cost, high-speed micropayments.

## Overview

PowerPay implements a novel probabilistic payment mechanism on Solana that increases transaction processing capacity by up to 3x compared to traditional blockchain systems. This approach is especially suitable for micropayments in Web3 applications.

## Features

- **Probabilistic Payment Model**: Reduces on-chain transaction volume while maintaining payment integrity
- **Solana Integration**: Leverages Solana's high throughput and low-cost transactions
- **Web3 Compatibility**: Seamless integration with decentralized applications
- **High Scalability**: Supports up to 3x more transaction processing than traditional models

## Architecture

- **Smart Contracts**: Solana programs implementing the probabilistic payment logic
- **Backend**: Node.js server handling payment aggregation and probabilistic logic
- **Frontend**: React-based wallet interface for users

## Technical Implementation

The core innovation is the probabilistic payment mechanism that:
1. Aggregates multiple micropayment intents
2. Uses cryptographically secure random number generation
3. Executes payments with probability proportional to payment amounts
4. Statistically guarantees accurate payments over time

## Development Status

Currently under active development.
